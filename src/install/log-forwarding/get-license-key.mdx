Before you begin, you'll need a valid New Relic license key. If you don't already have a New Relic account, [sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup?via=login). It's free, forever!

To generate a new key, go to the New Relic [API keys page](https://one.newrelic.com/api-keys), click **Create a key**, and then create an ingest-license key type. 

To copy an existing key, click **...**, then click **Copy key ID**.
