Our logging featuring offers a way for you to see all your logs in one place. By default, our APM agents send some logs, but if you want to send other kinds of logs, or you're using a third-party logging tool, configure your forwarder to send them to New Relic, and you'll see all your logs in one place. 

## Which log forwarder should I use?

Here are some examples of different kinds of logs you might want to send, and which log forwarder you can use.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        If you want to send logs from...

      <th>
        Use one of these log forwarders
      </th>
