The Kubernetes integration for Amazon EKS, EKS Anywhere, or EKS Anywhere on bare metal monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms.

To get started, make sure you are using the [AWS version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/configure-kubectl.html) of `kubectl`.
