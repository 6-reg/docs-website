After you've completed the guided installation, finalize the Kubernetes integration with [OpenShift](https://learn.openshift.com):

1. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the `DaemonSet` portion of your manifest, to set the `.pem` file:
    ```yaml
    env:
    - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR
        value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR
    - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE
        value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME
    ```
2. Set your YAML key path to `spec.template.spec.containers.name.env`.
3. Save your changes.
