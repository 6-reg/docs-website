As you get ready to install the integration, note that the Kubernetes integration only monitors worker nodes in GKE because Google abstracts the management of master nodes away from the Kubernetes platform.

To begin the setup of the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions:

1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam) and find your username. 
2. Click **edit**.
3. Ensure you have permissions to create `Roles` and `ClusterRoles`: If you are not sure, add the **Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin** role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions.
