Do you want to monitor the performance of your Kubernetes cluster? The New Relic Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment by leveraging the New Relic infrastructure agent. This agent collects metrics from your cluster alongside various other New Relic integrations such as the Kubernetes events integration, the Prometheus agent, and the New Relic log plugin.
