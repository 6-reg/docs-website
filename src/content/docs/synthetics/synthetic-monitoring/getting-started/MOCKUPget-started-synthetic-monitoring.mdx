You can think of our synthetic monitors as crash test dummies for your websites, applications, and API endpoints. When you deploy a synthetic monitor, an API check or virtual browser instance runs through your most important workflows, testing your critical endpoints and reporting the results to New Relic. If there's an error, failure, or anomaly affecting your customer-facing apps, then your synthetic monitor will catch it and alert you, all before anyone has any time to notice.

There's no installation when you get started with synthetic monitoring. All you need is a free New Relic account and something to monitor.

## Create your first monitor [#first]

Synthetics can perform scriptable checks on your customer-facing or internal apps, down to the HTTP headers. By mimicking the behaviors of customers, your monitors can test how well your web apps can handle traffic. This lets you proactively catch and resolve issues, whether it's a broken link, a failed API call, or significant changes in your app runtime.

The following tutorial walks you through setting up a ping monitor, a scripted browser monitor, and a scripted API monitor. 

<Steps>

<Step>

## Check website availability with ping monitors  

Ping monitors take a specified URL and monitor for availability via `HEAD` or `GET` requests. If the monitor reaches 60 seconds with no activity, it reports back to New Relic as a failed check.

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, select **Add data**, then search for **Synthetic monitoring**. Once you've selected ping monitor, give it a name, provide a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL, then specify a time duration between checks.

## Check customer workflows with scripted browser monitors

NOTE: Ping monitors don't "build into" other monitors (source: SME). While this isn't necessarily a linear tutorial, I think using a stepper component can give a recommended path / idea of "complexity" maybe, esp if we add introductory content that explains how it works. I like this component from Stripe that combines tabs with a side-by-side codeblock. I imagine for the scripted monitor examples, the tabs could include something like:

1. Monitor a URL
2. Navigate to a link
3. Search a website
4. Wait for a page to load
5. So on and so forth
