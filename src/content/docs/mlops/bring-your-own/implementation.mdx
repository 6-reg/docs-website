This guide takes you step by step for everything needed to start monitoring your machine learning models.

## Step 1. Set your environment variable [#set-env]

[Get your license key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher) (also referenced as `ingest - license`) and set it as environment variable: `NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY`.

[Click here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key) for more details and instructions.

## Step 2. Import the package [#package]

```python
from ml_performance_monitoring.monitor import MLPerformanceMonitoring
```

## Step 3. Create the model monitor [#model-monitor]

```python
metadata = {"environment": "notebook"}
model_version = "1.0"
features_columns, labels_columns = (
    ["feature_1", "feature_2", "feature_3", "feature_4"],
    ["target"],
)

ml_monitor = MLPerformanceMonitoring(
    insert_key=None,  # set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_INSERT_KEY or send your insert key here
    model_name="My stunning model",
    metadata=metadata,
    features_columns=features_columns,
    labels_columns=labels_columns,
    label_type="numeric",
    model_version=model_version
)
```

## Step 4. Run your model [#run-model]

```python
y = my_model.predict(X)
```

## Step 5. Record your model [#record-model]

```python
ml_performence_monitor_model.record_inference_data(X, y)
```

## Step 6. Monitor and alert [#monitor-alert]
