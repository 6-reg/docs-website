This is a guide to getting started when you bring your own data into New Relic. You'll learn how to install, run, and experiment with _bring your own data_ , or BYOD, and start monitoring the performance of your machine learning models.

Using _bring your own data_ , or BYOD, makes it easy to monitor your machine learning models in 3 main steps:

```python
# 1: Initialize the monitoring
ml_monitor = MLPerformanceMonitoring(...)

# 2: Add your algorithm
y = my_model.predict(X)

# 3: Record your data
ml_monitor.record_inference_data(X, y)
```

Use this example in [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/newrelic-experimental/ml-performance-monitoring/blob/main/examples/XGBoost_on_Boston_housing_prices_dataset.ipynb) and easily try an end-to-end example of model monitoring.
