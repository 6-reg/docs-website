Our multi-tenancy feature lets you have a New Relic organization that contains multiple sub-organizations within it. This is useful for large organizations that have departments they want to keep separate, and for managed service providers (MSPs) who need multiple tenant boundaries for their end users. 

## Requirements 

Requirements for our multi-tenancy feature: 

* [Enterprise edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions)
* Organizations must meet a few criteria to use this and must be approved: for more information, talk to your New Relic account representative

## Details on organization structure [#org-structure]

For an introduction to the basics of how New Relic organization and account structure works, see [Organizations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure). 

Here's a brief overview of the organization structure for our multi-tenant features:

* The top-level New Relic organization is called the **managing organization**.
* The sub-organizations within the managing organization are called the **member organizations**.
* Managing a member organization requires the `Tenant manager` role. 
* One account in the organization is considered the "reporting account". This is the account that aggregates all the billing-relevant usage from across all member organizations. This will usually be the first account created in an organization.

## Multi-tenancy features [#features]

Managing organizations have access to several features, including:

* **Account sharing.** This allows you to share an account with another organization. This can be useful for managing another organization's use of New Relic, or for any cross-organization collaboration. For details, see [Account sharing](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/multitenancy-accounts-nerdgraph#account-sharing). 
* **Add a member organization.** 
* **Admin delegration.** With this, you can give users admin permissions to manage the accounts, users, and permissions of member organizations.
