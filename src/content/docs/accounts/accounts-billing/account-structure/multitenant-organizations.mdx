**Multi-tenancy** gives New Relic customers more data segregation features by giving them the ability to set up multiple organizations. This is useful for large enterprises that have business units they want to keep separate, or for managed service providers (MSPs) who need to establish tenant boundaries between their end customers.

## Requirements 

Requirements for our multi-tenancy feature: 

* [Enterprise edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions)
* Organizations must meet a few criteria to use this and must be approved: for more information, talk to your New Relic account representative

## Details on organization structure [#org-structure]

For an introduction to the basics of how New Relic organization and account structure works, see [Organizations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure). 

Here's a brief overview of the organization structure for our multi-tenant features:

All multi-tenant customers have a single **managing organization** and multiple **member organizations**. Managing organizations have unique benefits compared to member organizations. These benefits include:

* Delegated administration
* Visibility into usage across organizations
* Ability to administer member organizations

For MSPs, the managing organization would be the MSP while each of the MSP's customers would be their own member organization.

To manage member organizations, a user would require the `Tenant manager` role.

## Multi-tenancy features [#features]

Managing organizations have access to several features, including:

* **Account sharing.** This allows you to share an account with another organization. This can be useful for managing another organization's use of New Relic, or for any cross-organization collaboration. For details, see [Account sharing](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/multitenancy-accounts-nerdgraph#account-sharing). 
* **Add a member organization.** 
* **Admin delegration.** With this, you can give users admin permissions to manage the accounts, users, and permissions of member organizations.
