Our New Relic Infrastructure agent and New Relic Flex to the instrument and monitor your SonarQube platform. Our SonarQube integration gives you a pre-built dashboard that allows you to evaluate the data from your project, such as line duplications, flaws, and other mistakes in order to diagnose and optimize the code.

## Install [#install]

### Step 1 (optional): Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

Installing the infrastructure agent is optional, but doing this will get you important metrics about the host where your app is running. 

To do this, follow [the infrastructure agent install steps](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) for the host containing your Flutter app.

### Step 2: Configure New Relic Flex [#browser-install] 

Our SonarQube integration relies on our New Relic Flex tool to work. To learn more and check requirements review our [Flex docs](docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration/)

1. Generate a SonarQube user token at [**User > My Account > Security**](https://docs.sonarqube.org/9.8/user-guide/user-account/generating-and-using-tokens/#using-a-token).
2. Name your token.
3. Make sure that you've selected **User token** as your **Type**.
4. Create a nri-flex configuration file like `nri-flex-config.yml` using this path: `etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ `
4. Add these configuration lines in the config file:
```
integrations:
  - name: nri-flex
    # interval: 30s
    config:
      name: sonarFlex
      apis:
        - name: sonarSampleStatus
          commands:
            - run: curl -u <sonarqube_user_token>: http://localhost:9000/api/monitoring/metrics
              split_by: ": "
          snake_to_camel: true
```

8. Restart your application. 

Wait five minutes and then proceed to finding your data in New Relic. 

## Find your data [#find-data]

To get your SonarQube dashboard: 

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the [**Add data** page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace). 
2. Click on **Dashboards**.
3. In the search bar, type `SonarQube`. 
4. The Flutter dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

Your SonarQube dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the **Dashboards** UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

This integration reports data in the form of our [browser monitoring events](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/event-data/events-reported-browser-monitoring). If you installed the infrastructure agent, you'll also receive [infrastructure data](/docs/infrastructure/manage-your-data/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-monitoring-data/#infrastructure-events). 

Here's an example NRQL query checking the average window load time for the various browsers used by users on desktop computers: 

```sql
SELECT latest(sonarqube_web_uptime_minutes) 
FROM Metric 
```
