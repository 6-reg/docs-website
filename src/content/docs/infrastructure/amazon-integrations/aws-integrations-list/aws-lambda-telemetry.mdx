The New Relic AWS Lambda Telemetry extension allows users to send telemetry data straight from their lambda functions into New Relic, with no need to set up triggers or connect Amazon CloudWatch. Send your logs, events, metrics and traces by simply adding the extension as the layer and inputting your New Relic license key.

## Installation

1. Ensure you are in the ``us-west-2 (Oregon)` region.
2. In the AWS Console go to **Lambda** > **Functions** and choose the function you'd like to ingest data from.
3. Select **Layers** > **Add Layer**.
4. In **Choose a layer** select the **Specify a layer by providing the ARN** option.
5. Copy and paste `arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:533243300146:layer:AwsLambdaExtension:4` in the field, then click **Add**.
6. Go to **Configuration**, select **Environment variables** and add **Key: LICENSE_KEY  Value: LICENSE_KEY**. 

To verify that set up has been done correctly, click the **Test** button in **code** section. 

## Find your data

After the test has completed, you can find your data on New Relic by navigating to **[https://one.newrelic.com/](https://one.newrelic.com/)** > **Browse data** > then selecting one of 4 categories: **Logs, Events, Metrics or Traces**.

### Logs:

Logs can be filtered by specific attributes set. Click **Attributes** in left menu and then choose the attributes of interest. For example:

```
SOURCE > api.logs
PLUGIN > TYPE > lambda extension

```

'maxMemoryUsedMB'
'producedBytes'
```
