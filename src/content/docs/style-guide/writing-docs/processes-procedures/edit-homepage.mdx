You can't just hit the edit button docs.newrelic.com to make edits to the home page. The homepage copy and code is governed by two pages:

* [`src/pages/index.js`](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/pages/index.js): Tile structure, link destinations, and logic.
* [`src/i18n/translations/en/translation.json`](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/src/i18n/translations/en/translation.json): Titles for tiles and some other homepage copy.

## Update a link's URL

To change or add a link, you'll need to update the relevant copy in both `index.js` and `translation.json`. The exact syntax depends on which part of the homepage you're changing. The easiest way to make the update is to search each file for the relevant text, make your change, and check the preview build.

## Edit the home page left nav [#left-nav]

The left nav of the home page is controlled by [`src/nav/root.yml`](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/commits/develop/src/nav/root.yml). This is a basic `yml` file, similar to our taxonomy files. Each link on the left nav needs a `title` and a `path`:

```
  - title: Welcome to New Relic
    path: /docs/using-new-relic
  - title: New Relic platform
    path: /docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one
  - title: Guides and best practices
    path: /docs/new-relic-solutions
  - title: section-break
  - title: Alerts and applied intelligence  
    path: /docs/alerts-applied-intelligence
```

You can add a new link by following the pattern above or delete a link by removing the corresponding title and path. Section breaks are added by including a `- title: SECTION_TITLE` line with no `path` element. The left nav reflects the exact order of `root.yml`, so it's easy to organize it as needed.
