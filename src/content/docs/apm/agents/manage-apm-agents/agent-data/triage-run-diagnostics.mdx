We all know what it's like to wake up in the morning to a ping from your leadership team telling you that something is going wrong and they need it fixed as soon as possible. This is where our APM tools come in. When you have limited time and increased urgency, you can use APM to run diagnostics and triage issues in eight clicks. 

For this example we're going to explore a situation where you work for an e-commerce company and you manage the checkout team. You are alerted to the fact that the `Pay Now` button is failing and customers can't checkout. 

<Steps>

<Step>
### Open APM [#open-apm]
Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > All capabilities > APM and Services**.

From there, click on the application that's causing the `Pay Now` button to fail. For this example, the app will be called `Checkout-service`.

    src={apmCheckoutServiceinApm}
/>
</Step>

<Step>

### Select a time period [#time-picker]

It's important to make sure that you are looking at the right time segment. Based on the message you got from your leadership team, you know the checkout issues are happening now and so you want to hone in on what's actively happening in your system. Click on the **Time Picker** in the top-left, and select **Since 30 minutes ago**.

</Step>

<Step>

### Find the problematic transaction [#transactions]

You know that checkout is failing in your app but you're unsure of what's causing the actual error. In order to figure out what part of the checkout process is breaking you need to investigate your apps `Transactions`. A transaction represents the “work” that happens from when your application receives a request to when it sends a response. In order to figure out which transaction is breaking, click on the **Transactions** tab.

If a transaction is slow it can be a strong indicator that something is behaving abnormally.  Once you click into **Transactions** you will see a list of all the "work" that is happening behind the scenes for your `checkout-service` application. On the left-hand side you will see which of your transactions is taking the most time. Click on your slowest transaction. For the purpose of this example, the slowest transaction is `Sinatra/Rubytron/POST #purchaseCart.`

    alt="A gif showing you how to dive deep into transactions"
    src={apmTransactionsTabinApmOverview}
/>

</Step>

<Step>
### Dig deeper into your slowest transaction [#slow-transactions]

Each transaction is comprised of many different units of "work." The **Transactions detail** page dives deep into a single transaction by breaking it down into individual pieces of "work". The histogram on top shows you which pieces of the transaction are responding slower than others. 

So, for the `Sinatra/Rubytron/POST #purchaseCart` transaction there are many different areas where the transaction could be failing: databases, servers. You can toggle between each different segment of the transaction to identify trends and spikes. In this case, the controller, `Sinatra/Rubytron/POST` is the slowest segment and is taking 59.83% of the transactions total time.

    src={accountsSelectSlowestTransaction}
/>

</Step>

<Step>
### Take a look at throughput 

While looking at response time for this transaction, you can also investigate throughput. Throughput is a way to measure the amount of work your application is handling. 

Since you're experiencing a spike in errors in the `checkout-service` application and the `Sinatra/Rubytron/POST #purchaseCart` transaction, it's helpful to compare those errors with your throughput results. 

If your throughput is very high during a time of service degradation it could indicate that your application is processing more work than it can handle. On the other hand, low throughput could indicate that your app isn't handling very many requests. This could simply mean that it's not used very much or it could mean that a service upstream that calls to your application is broken and requests aren't being processed.

</Step>

<Step>

### Investigate your transaction breakdown

The transaction breakdown refers to the detailed breakdown of the time spent on each operation within a specific transaction. This breakdown helps developers understand the performance of the application and identify bottlenecks or areas for improvement.

You can sort the transaction breakdown by **Category**, **% Time**, **Avg Calls/Txn**, and **Avg Time**. We recommend sorting by **% Time** to understand which piece of the transaction is taking up the most time within each transaction. 

Once you sort the **Breakdown table**, you can click on any problem transactions.

</Step>

<Step>
### Explore transaction traces

When your customers are trying to purchase something on your site and they use the `Pay Now` button, the `Checkout-service` application generates multiple database queries, API calls, and other interactions with the underlying infrastructure. Transaction traces keep a record of every interaction between `Checkout-service` and your customers. 

Transaction traces can provide a wealth of information, including:

    *The time spent on each segment of a transaction, such as database queries, external API calls, or rendering of HTML pages.
    *The parameters passed to each segment of a transaction, allowing developers to identify specific data that may be causing issues.
    *Information about errors or exceptions that occurred during a transaction.
    *Information about the overall performance of the application, such as response times and throughput.

<Step>
### Take a look at trace details 

<img
    title="Trace details"
    alt="A screenshot showing trace details for a transaction trace"
    src={apmTraceDetails}

</Step>
<Step>
And now you have all the information you need to being resolving the problem with your app's checkout. You know which transaction is causing the service degradation, you know when the problem started, and you know which piece of the transaction is causing the breakdown in service. You and your team can now start fixing the origin of the problem and get your checkout up-and-running as quickly as possible.
