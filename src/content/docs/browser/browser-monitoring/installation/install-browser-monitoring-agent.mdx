To get started with browser monitoring, you'll need to add a JavaScript snippet, which we call our browser agent, to your webpage HTML. Then the agent will collect browser data like JavaScript errors, core web vitals, and other performance data, and will sent that data to New Relic where you can view it in your New Relic UI.  

Now, let's get started setting up browser monitoring in the steps below. 

## Before you begin 

1. Review our [browser compatibility and requirements](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring). 
2. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever!

  If you already have an account, sign in. You'll be completing the installation steps in the New Relic UI. 

<Steps>

<Step>
## Add a browser app in the New Relic UI

First, you'll need to add your browser app to the New Relic UI:

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, click **Add data**. Under **Data sources** select **Browser monitoring**. 

<img

  alt="Add your browser app in the UI"
  src={browserInstallStep1}
  style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }}
/>

<Callout variant="tip">
Need to add your browser app via an API? You can [use our Nerdgraph API to create a browser app](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/browser-monitoring-config-nerdgraph#create-browser).
  </Callout>
</Step>
<Step>
## Choose a deployment method [#step-3]

When it comes to installing the browser agent, you've got two options depending on how you plan to use New Relic:

* Option 1: Auto-instrument via a New Relic APM agent (recommended for non-SPA apps)
  * If you're using an <InlinePopover type="apm" /> (application performance monitoring) agent to monitor the backend-side of your browser app, then you should use the APM injection option. We recommend this option for non-SPA apps because the APM agent will automatically deploy the browser agent to every page of your website, you'll automatically get the latest version of the browser agent whenever you restart your APM agent, and you'll see how backend performance influences the frontend.
* Option 2: Manually copy and paste the Javascript snippet (recommended for SPA apps)
  * Use this method if you can't use the first option, due to reasons like you have a SPA app or your APM agent isn't supported for auto-injection ( Node.js, Java agents). 

In your New Relic UI, select an option and move on to the next step. 
</Step>

<Step>
## Configure the browser agent instrumentation

Next, you can choose to enable distributed tracing. Read more about distributed tracing [here](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/browser-data-distributed-tracing/).

<img
  title="enable distributed tracing"
  alt="enable distributed tracing"
  src={browserInstallStep3}
  style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }}
/>
</Step>

<Step>
## Name your browser app

When selecting a name for your browser app, you've got two options: 

* Select an existing app already monitored by an APM agent. 
* Create a new name for a standalone browser app. 

Choose one of these options and click **Enable**. 

<img
  title="name or connect an existing browser app"
  alt="name or connect an existing browser app"
  src={browserInstallStep4}
  style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }}
/>
</Step>

<Step>
## (For copy/paste method only) Inject the JavaScript snippet

If you selected the copy/paste option, it's time to add the JavaScript snippet to each of your browser app webpages' HTML. 

In the UI, copy the JavaScript snippet that's been customized for your app instrumentation, and paste it into the `head` of each of your wedpages. Make sure to paste it as close to the top of the `head` as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (such as X-UA-Compatible and charset). For more information on the snippet placement, see [JavaScript placement requirements](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/instrumentation-browser-monitoring#javascript-placement)

## Generate traffic for your app [#step-6]

Congratulations, you're done with installing the browser agent! Now you'll need to generate traffic for your app and wait a few minutes for data to appear in New Relic.

<Callout variant="tip">
### Not seeing data? 

It may take several minutes after enabling the browser monitoring agent before your webpage data appear in New Relic. If you're still not seeing data, check out [common browser installation problems and solutions](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-your-browser-monitoring-installation/).

</Step>

</Steps>

## What's next? 

* View your app data on the [Summary page](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/browser-summary-page/).

* Learn how to optimize your browser monitoring experience with our [best practices guide for browser monitoring](/docs/new-relic-solutions/best-practices-guides/full-stack-observability/browser-monitoring-best-practices-guide/). 

* Make additional configurations to the browser agent instrumentation by going to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings**.

* [Change your browser agent type from browser Lite to Pro or Pro+SPA](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/change-browser-agent-type).
