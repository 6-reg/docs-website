Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue. With browser monitoring in New Relic, you can see, query, visualize, and set up alerts with actionable data about your end users' experience with your app. And if you're already monitoring your app with APM, you can use the APM agent to add browser monitoring for you.

## Monitor your browser app [#core-web-vitals]

Real user monitoring (RUM) gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perceptions of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content.

Browser monitoring in New Relic provides a real user monitoring (RUM) solution that measures speed and performance as your end users navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. But browser monitoring goes far beyond the initial page load. Measure [full page life cycle data](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process) in the browser monitoring UI to get:

<img
  title="test image"
  alt="test image"
  src={img4}
/>
<img
  title="test image"
  alt="test image"
  src={img5}
/>
