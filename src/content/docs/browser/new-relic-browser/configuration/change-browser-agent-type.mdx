metaDescription: Change your browser agent type to Lite, Pro, or Pro+SPA
---

If you got started with the free version of New Relic and you're ready to optimize all our powerful browser monitoring features, you can upgrade your agent from Browser+Lite to Browser Pro or Browser+SPA. 

To change your browser edition type, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings**.

Here are some comparisons between the different browser agent types to help you decide which one best fits your needs:

## Browser agent types: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA [#agent-types]

We have three types of browser agents: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. The agent type has no impact on your billing.

      <th style={{ width: "150px" }}>
        Browser agent type

        This is the default installed agent when you enable browser monitoring.

        What it includes:

        * Gives you access to all of the [Browser Pro features](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features) and to [Single Page App (SPA) monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/introduction-single-page-app-monitoring/).
        * Provides detailed page timing data and the most up-to-date New Relic features, including [distributed tracing](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/browser-data-distributed-tracing), for all types of applications.

          Pro+SPA is not limited only to single page applications. After install, you can downgrade anytime to the less advanced agents if you don't want or need SPA monitoring.

## Browser SPA features [#features]

Here is a summary of SPA monitoring features:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        **Single-page app monitoring**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Take advantage of these features**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Robust views in browser's UI
      </td>

      <td>
        When a user initiates a page load or route change, New Relic begins to monitor all subsequent JavaScript, and ends the timing once all AJAX events are complete. This provides a more accurate view of when a page is actually ready for a user compared to the traditional method of ending the timing when the window load event is fired.

        When SPA monitoring is enabled, the [**Page views** page](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/browser-ui/view-spa-data-new-relic-browser) in browser shows event-driven data about application usage levels (throughput) and user experience (performance), including:

        * Charts with drill-down details about initial page load performance, route changes, and historical performance
        * Sort, search, and filter options, including custom attributes
        * Additional AJAX breakdown data for all initial page loads and route changes

          For an explanation of how SPA monitoring will impact your existing browser account's data usage, see [SPA and browser data usage](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/spa-monitoring-new-relic-data-usage).

      </td>

      <td>
        [Metrics and events](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer) supports three SPA-specific event types: [`BrowserInteraction`](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/browser-default-attributes-insights#browserinteraction-attributes), [`AjaxRequest`](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/browser-default-attributes-insights#ajaxrequest-attributes), and [`BrowserTiming`](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-events-attributes/browser-default-events-attributes-insights#browsertiming-attributes). You can query these events in the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data) to analyze your app's performance and make business decisions.

## Pricing details

Check out these docs to learn more about pricing for each browser agent type:
* [Usage-based pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing): This pricing model has data ingest as a billing factor. If you want to reduce data ingest, you may want to consider downgrading to lesser agent types after install.
* [Original pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing): Your access to browser monitoring features is gated by your subscription plan, not by the agent type. This means there is no reason not to use the default Pro+SPA agent.
