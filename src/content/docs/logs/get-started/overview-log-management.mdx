As applications move towards the cloud, microservices architecture is becoming more dispersed, making the ability to monitor logs essential. New Relic offers a fast, scalable log management platform so you can connect your logs with the rest of your telemetry and infrastructure data in a single place.  

Our log management solution provides deeper visibility into application and infrastructure performance data (events, errors, traces, and more) to reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) and quickly troubleshoot production incidents.

## Find problems faster, reduce context switching [#logs-definition]

Log management provides a way to connect your log data with the rest of your application and infrastructure data. You can get to the root cause of problems quickly, without losing context from switching between tools. For example, you can:

* Get relevant data across the New Relic UI that provides logs in context of issues in your apps and hosts.
* Dive deeper into log data by using our Logs UI, and create custom charts, dashboards, and alerts.
* Instantly search through your logs.
* Troubleshoot performance issues without switching between other tools.
* Visualize everything in a single place.

## (Optional) Forward logs to New Relic

By default, our APM agents do two things: add metadata to your logs, which gives you logs in context (ability to see logs data in various relevant places in our platform) and forward your logs to New Relic. This is a popular option for DevOps teams and smaller organizations because it lets you easily report application logs, with no additional third-party solutions required.

Aside from our APM agents, we provide several other solutions to forward your logs to New Relic. See [Configure log forwarders](/docs/logs/forward-logs/enable-log-management-new-relic) to get started.


## Curious about costs? [#costs]

Want to estimate the cost of reporting your logs? Use our [cost estimator tool](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/estimate-data-cost). Also note that once you start using New Relic log management, it's easy to [adjust your logs ingest](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic). 

For tips on how to reduce logging costs, see our [logging best practices guide](/Users/asassman/Desktop/GitHub/docs-website/src/content)/docs/logs/get-started/logging-best-practices#sizing)

## What's next [#what-next]

* (Optional) [Configure a log forwarder](/docs/logs/forward-logs/enable-log-management-new-relic) to send all kinds of log data to New Relic. 
* View, query, and create alerts and dashboards for your logs using our [Logs UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui).
