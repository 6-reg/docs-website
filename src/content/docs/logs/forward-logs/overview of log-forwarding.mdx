Log forwarding is a way to collect and send your host logs so you can have all your logs in one place. By default, our APM agents collect application-level logs. But if you want to send host logs, you can set up log forwarding depending on what kind of host you have. 

We offer many options to forward host logs, which are listed in the table below. Basically, you can use one of our log fowarding options (i.e., our infrastructure agent, Kubernetes plugin, or log API) or a third-party log forwarder (i.e., AWS, Azure, GCP).

To get started with log forwarding, click one of the links in the table and follow instructions on that page.

        * (Recommended) Enable our infrastructure agent to send your host logs. By default, our APM agents send application-side logs, but if you want to also send host logs, you can do things like collect custom attributes, which you can't do with APM agents. To get started, see [Configure the infrastructure agent to forward logs](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/).

        For Kubernetes environments, use our [Kubernetes plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/kubernetes-plugin-log-forwarding/).
        
        For Docker environments, we offer a few options:
        * Use our [APM logs in context](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context)
        * Use our infrastructure agent. In the `logging.yml` config file be sure to tail the `/var/log/containers/*.log` directory. For example:
          ```yml
          logs:
           - name: Docker-logs
             file: /var/log/containers/*.log # Path to Docker log files
          ```
        * Use our [Standalone Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/newrelic-fluentbit-output).
