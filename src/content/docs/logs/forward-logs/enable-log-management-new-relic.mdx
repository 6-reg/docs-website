Our logging featuring offers a way for you to see all your logs in one place. By default, if you're monitoring your app with out APM agents, the agents are collecting logs and showing that data in logs-in-context, which is the ability to see logs data in various relevant places in our platform. 

But if you want to send more logs to New Relic, we offer these log forwarding options:

* Enable our infrastructure agent to send logs from your host. Compared to using an APM agent to report logs, this takes more setup, but it gives you much more powerful options (for example, ability to collect custom attributes, which you can't do with APM agents). To get started, see [Configure the infrastructure agent to forward logs](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/).
* Configure third-party log services to forward logs to New Relic. We have a wide range of integrations for other log services, including Amazon, Microsoft, Fluentd, Fluent Bit, Kubernetes, Logstash, and more. To get started, see these docs:
  * [Fluent Bit plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/fluent-bit-plugin-log-forwarding)
  * [Fluentd plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/fluentd-plugin-log-forwarding)
  * [Logstash plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/logstash-plugin-log-forwarding/)
  * [Syslog/TCP](/docs/logs/log-management/log-api/use-tcp-endpoint-forward-logs-new-relic)
  * [AWS CloudFront plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/cloudfront-web-logs)
  * [AWS CloudWatch plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/aws-lambda-sending-cloudwatch-logs/)
  * [AWS FireLens plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/aws-firelens-plugin-log-forwarding/)
  * [AWS Kinesis Firehose](/docs/logs/forward-logs/stream-logs-using-kinesis-data-firehose/)
  * [AWS Lambda for sending logs from S3](/docs/logs/forward-logs/aws-lambda-sending-logs-s3/)
  * [Azure ARM template](/docs/logs/forward-logs/azure-log-forwarding/)
  * Akamai DataStream 2:

  * [Kubernetes plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/kubernetes-plugin-log-forwarding/)
  * [Vector plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/vector-output-sink-log-forwarding)
* Reports logs using the Log API or TCP endpoint.
* Use the OpenTelemetry SDK to send logs from your apps to an OpenTelemetry collector, which can forward them to New Relic via OTLP.


## What's next? [#what-next]

Once you've got all your logs in one place, check out our logging features:

* Explore the logging data across your platform with our [Logs UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui).
* See your logs in context of your app's performance in the [APM UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links). Troubleshoot [errors](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/error-analytics/errors-page-find-fix-verify-problems/) with [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-data), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data if you are forwarding your logs with our [infrastructure monitoring agent](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/). Review your [infrastructure logs](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links) in the UI.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/). For example, see our NerdGraph tutorials to query and manage your [data partition rules](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-data-partition-rules-tutorial) and your [log parsing rules](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-log-parsing-rules-tutorial).
