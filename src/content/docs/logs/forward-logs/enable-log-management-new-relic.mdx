Our logging featuring offers a way for you to see all your logs in one place. By default, our APM agents send some logs, but if you want to send other kinds of logs, or you're using a third-party logging tool, configure your forwarder to send them to New Relic, and you'll see all your logs in one place. 

## Which log forwarder should I use?

Here are some examples of different kinds of logs you might want to send, and which log forwarder you can use.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        If you want to send logs from...
      </th>
      <th>
        Use one of these log forwarders
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

If you're ready to start forwarding other logs to New Relic, follow the steps below.

## Get started with log forwarders [#compatibility-requirements]

You can forward logs via our infrastructure agent or one of our supported third-party log services. Here's how:

1. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever.

<InlineSignup/>
2. Have your New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> ready for the account you want to report logs to.
3. Install a [compatible log forwarder](#log-forwarding).
4. Ensure that outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the [CIDR range](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/install-configure/networks/#infrastructure) that matches your [region](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers).
5. Depending on where your account data is stored in New Relic, use the DNS name `log-api.newrelic.com` or `log-api.eu.newrelic.com` for configuration.
6. If applicable, configure your app's <InlinePopover type="apm" /> agent by following the [manual logs in context](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/) procedures.

## Log forwarding options [#log-forwarding]

Aside from [our APM agents](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context), we provide several other solutions to forward your logs to New Relic. 

### Infrastructure agent (recommended) and OS solutions [#forward-infra]

Using our infrastructure agent is one recommended path for log management because it gives you some powerful log reporting and configuration options. For details about setting this up, see [Infrastructure agent logs](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent).

If you don't need the host metrics automatically included with infrastructure log forwarding, or if you already have a log forwarder, you can use any of the following options to forward your logs to New Relic:

* [Fluent Bit plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/fluent-bit-plugin-log-forwarding)
* [Fluentd plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/fluentd-plugin-log-forwarding)
* [Logstash plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/logstash-plugin-log-forwarding/)
* [Syslog/TCP](/docs/logs/log-management/log-api/use-tcp-endpoint-forward-logs-new-relic)

### Amazon [#forward-amazon]

We support the following Amazon log forwarders:

* [AWS CloudFront plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/cloudfront-web-logs)
* [AWS CloudWatch plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/aws-lambda-sending-cloudwatch-logs/)
* [AWS FireLens plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/aws-firelens-plugin-log-forwarding/)
* [AWS Kinesis Firehose](/docs/logs/forward-logs/stream-logs-using-kinesis-data-firehose/)
* [AWS Lambda for sending logs from S3](/docs/logs/forward-logs/aws-lambda-sending-logs-s3/)

### Microsoft [#forward-microsoft]

We support the following Microsoft log forwarder:

* [Azure ARM template](/docs/logs/forward-logs/azure-log-forwarding/)

### Other supported log forwarders [#forward-other]

We support the following log forwarders. Some of these options come with quickstarts, which give you out-of-the-box <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> and alerts. You can install quickstarts after setting up your log forwarding.

* Akamai DataStream 2: 
  * [Akamai instructions](https://techdocs.akamai.com/datastream2/docs/stream-new-relic)
  * [Quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/datastream2/cb995039-39d8-44d9-97c3-58174a1337f2)
* [Cloudflare Logpush](/docs/logs/forward-logs/cloudflare-logpush-forwarding)
* Fastly:

  * [Quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/fastly-cdn/c5c5dd30-dcdf-46b6-9412-f9a1bba5a600)
* [Google Cloud Platform Pub/Sub](/docs/logs/forward-logs/google-cloud-platform-log-forwarding)
* [Heroku log streaming](/docs/logs/forward-logs/heroku-log-forwarding/)
* [Kubernetes plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/kubernetes-plugin-log-forwarding/)
* [Vector plugin](/docs/logs/forward-logs/vector-output-sink-log-forwarding)

<InstallFeedback />

## TCP endpoint [#enable-endpoint]

In some situations you may not have log forwarders; for example, with CDNs, hardware devices, or managed services. You can use syslog protocols such as `rsyslog` and `syslog-ng`, and forward your logs to New Relic via a [TCP endpoint](/docs/logs/log-management/log-api/use-tcp-endpoint-forward-logs-new-relic/).

## Log API [#enable-api]

If you prefer to connect to New Relic without installing a plugin, we offer an HTTP input integration. This option sends your monitored log data directly to New Relic via the [Log API](/docs/logs/log-api/introduction-log-api).


## What's next? [#what-next]

After you enable your log forwarder, make the most of your data in New Relic with our log management capabilities:

* Explore the logging data across your platform with our [Logs UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui).
* See your logs in context of your app's performance in the [APM UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links). Troubleshoot [errors](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/error-analytics/errors-page-find-fix-verify-problems/) with [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-data), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data if you are forwarding your logs with our [infrastructure monitoring agent](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/). Review your [infrastructure logs](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links) in the UI.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/). For example, see our NerdGraph tutorials to query and manage your [data partition rules](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-data-partition-rules-tutorial) and your [log parsing rules](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-log-parsing-rules-tutorial).
