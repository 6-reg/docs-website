**Step 3. Check out some dashboards**

Now that you've got some data coming in, it's time to explore your environment in real time with some out-of-the-box UI views. You should see data in the **Infrastructure**, **APM**, and **Logs** UI pages. If you don't see that, revisit the install instructions or see [Not seeing data](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/troubleshooting/not-seeing-data). 

Some tips on understanding those UI pages and more: 
* Video: [An intro to the platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZCUujeAkMA) (2:20)
* [APM UI](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/apm-summary-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data)
* [Infrastructure UI](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-ui-entities)
* [Logs UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui)
* [Distributed tracing UI](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui) 
* [Service maps](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/introduction-service-maps)

Want to build your own dashboards? To build charts, you'll need to learn to [query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder).
