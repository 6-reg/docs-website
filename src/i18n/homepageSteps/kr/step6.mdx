**Step 6. Add users**

You're now ready to add the rest of your team to New Relic. Use the [**User management** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks#where) to add users. To learn about the different types of users, see [User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type). See [our tutorial on adding users and managing user access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial).
