metaDescription: "Here's how to use the New Relic CLI to designate what you want to capture with change tracking."
---

The change tracking feature is a good way to monitor the effects of specific changes on your customers and systems. You do this by designating which changes you want to monitor and then viewing the results in the New Relic UI.

While you can designate which changes you want to monitor by using GraphQL or a CI/CD integration, you can also use our CLI to do the same thing. If you use the CLI to designate the changes you want to monitor, you can run either a [GraphQL query](#list-with-graphql) or execute an [NRQL query](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-graphql#key-signals) against the New Relic database to retrieve a list of those changes.
